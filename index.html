							<h1>Niranjani Wagh</h1>
							<p> Watching a YouTube video titled ‘Why Machine Learning is the future’ by Sundar Pichai gave me a feeling of consciousness, back in February 2017. 
								He states that better computational power and access to a lot of relevant data are the two main causes of the progress in ML. Working with data - whether it is data mining, 
								data analysis or data visualization and emphasizing it with ML algorithms or data storage has always made me feel exhilarating. 
								My immediate goal after masters is to become a Machine Learning Engineer. 
								In the long run I envision myself becoming a Data Scientist as I am hugely inspired by D J Patil, Former Chief Data Scientist at the White House, 
								first ever chief data scientist appointed by US government. His markers about striving for curiosity, team building, social and local problem solving always inspire me to crave for becoming a CDS.
								Apart from academics, I have been a part of many activities during my under graduation. Having participated in basket ball and having managed various events has not only improved my decision making but has also made me composed and tolerant. 
								The leadership quality during my tenure as a Head-Girl in my school and President of the department in my under graduation has also strengthened me with respect to the decision making power.  
								I am a motivated and a versatile engineer with demonstrated experience in Machine Learning domain. Experienced in data extraction, developing ML algorithms and developing final predictive model. I believe that I am a strong problem solver, technical writer and have excellent communication skills. 
								I am dedicated to exceeding goals and expectations.

									<h2>Internships</h2>
									<p>Internships give the first hand exposure working in the real world. It allows us to implement skill, knowlegde and
										 the theoretical practice learnt before. I beleive that it is a learning curve with little experience of the professional world.
										  I have completed two internships through the recent years in my life..</p>

							<h2>Projects</h2>
							<p>I am of the opinion that hands on coding or projects are the basic literacy in the digital world.
								It is really important for a programmer to understand and be able to work with the technology around him or her.
								I have been coding since my engineering and below are a few examples to demonstrate my knowlegde, creativity, math and confidence.

									<h3>Halma Game Playing Agent</h3>
									<p>The game of Halma, an adversarial game with some similarities to checkers. The game uses a 16x16 checkered gameboard. 
										Each player starts with 19 game pieces clustered in diagonally opposite corners of the board. To win the game, a player needs to
										 transfer all of their pieces from their starting corner to the opposite corner, into the positions that were initially occupied by the opponent.

									<h3>Email Classification</h3>
									<p>Naive Bayes classifiers are a popular statistical technique of e-mail filtering. They typically use bag of words features to identify spam e-mail, an approach commonly used in text classification.  
										Naive Bayes classifiers work by correlating the use of tokens (typically words, or sometimes other things), with spam and non-spam e-mails and then using Bayes' theorem to calculate a probability that an email is or is not spam.</p>
